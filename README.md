The Speech is most prominent & one of the natural forms of communication among of human
being. The speech is a signal of infinite information. There are different aspects related to speech
like speech recognition, speech verification, speech synthesis, speaker recognition, speaker
identification etc. The speaking calculator is a promising implementation of speech-recognition
technology, which is designed to recognise numbers and symbols to perform mathematical
operations. The development includes an extensive study of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which
is currently the state of art in the field of speech recognition. This calculator might be used for the
people with functional disability.
